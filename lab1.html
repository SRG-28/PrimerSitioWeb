                 <h1> Music definition</h1>
                <li> Sounds produced by instruments or voices singing </li>
                <li> A pattern of sounds that is made by playing instruments or singing </li>
                <li> Written signs representing sounds that can be sung or played </li>
                <h1>Music (n.)</h1>
                mid-13c., musike, "a pleasing succession of sounds or combinations of sounds; the science of combining sounds in rhythmic, melodic, and (later) harmonic order," from Old French musique (12c.) and directly from Latin musica "the art of music," also including poetry (also source of Spanish musica, Italian musica, Old High German mosica, German Musik, Dutch muziek, Danish musik), from Greek mousikē (technē) "(art) of the Muses," from fem. of mousikos "pertaining to the Muses; musical; educated," from Mousa "Muse" (see muse (n.)). Modern spelling from 1630s. In classical Greece, any art in which the Muses presided, but especially music and lyric poetry. 

                The use of letters to denote music pitch probably is at least as old as ancient Greece, as their numbering system was ill-suited to the job. Natural scales begin at C (not A) because in ancient times the minor mode was more often used than the major one, and the natural minor scale begins at A.
                
                Meaning "the written or printed score of a composition" is from 1650s. Music box is from 1773, originally "barrel organ," by 1845 in reference to the wind-up mechanical device; music hall is by 1842 as "interior space used for musical performances," especially "public hall licensed for musical entertainment" (1857). To face the music "accept the consequences" is from 1850; the exact image is uncertain, one theory ties it to stage performers, another to cavalry horses having to be taught to stay calm while the regimental band plays. To make (beautiful) music with someone "have sexual intercourse" is from 1967. <br> <br> <br> <br> </div>

            <h1> Music Genders</h1>
            <ol>
                <li> Pop:  As the label itself indicates, pop music is surely the most popular genre in the music market. It is a bit tricky, however, to clearly define what pop music is, as it has evolved so much through time.  </li>
                <li> Hip-hop and Rap: These two genres, originating in the Eighties but with some ancient roots planted in the Blues and the Gospel too, presented an incredible evolution that made them a sort of standard for the mainstream.</li>
                <li> Rock: Rock evolved directly from the Blues, and it became popular in the Fifties, first in the United States and then in Great Britain. From London, it slowly but steadily spread all over Europe, where it became the perfect soundtrack to the ideological turmoil of the Sixties.</li>
                <li> Indie and Alternative Rock: The label Indie has evolved a lot throughout the last three decades. Once indicating the D.I.Y. bands deriving directly from the Punk wave, it now applies to glamorous singers and songwriters or bands who are very far from the D.I.Y. approach of their predecessors.</li>
                <li> Country: Loved by Americans and also praised in Europe, this genre keeps evolving through time, adding elements of more popular styles to its repertoire but strongly keeping its identity.</li>
                <li> Dance and Electronic music: The rise of computers and digital technology allowed producers to explore new ways to make music. We no longer need a musical instrument to write or produce a song. We just need a computer.</li>
                <li> Classical music: There’s no doubt: classical music is still a huge part of our culture. While orchestras may not sound so mainstream, people all over the world and of any age still listen to symphonies, operas, and concertos.</li>
                <li> Metal: With loud distorted guitars, fast drum fills, often accompanying scary or creepy images, Metal became the perfect genre for anyone who wanted to rebel against conformism and taste something truly different.</li>
            </ol>
